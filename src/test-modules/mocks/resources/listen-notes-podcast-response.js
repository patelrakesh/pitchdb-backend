Chris Curran has a background in podcast production (Forbes, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, J&amp;J, etc) as well as music production (Sarah McLachlan, Jeff Buckley, Foreigner, etc). When he entered podcasting about 7 years ago, he noticed that most podcasters (and producers) do not have a solid understanding of fundamental audio engineering concepts, which sabotages the quality of their sound from the very beginning. This show, as well as the Podcast Engineering School, helps producers and podcasters reach professional levels of podcast production.`,
